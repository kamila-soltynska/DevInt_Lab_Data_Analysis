# DevInt_Lab_Data_Analysis
Data analysis from my Data Science Internship with the Developmental Inteligence Lab at the University of Texas at Austin

This data analysis involved different visualisations of eye traacking data in order to discern patterns. The method for the experiment was such that subjects observed a screen with various objects (both target and novel) after a learning phase. Gaze was tracked in order to investigate how words are learned in the process of childhood development.

Data was collected using the EyeLink1000. Outputs were then converted from a Matlab matrix to a csv format for analysis in R.
